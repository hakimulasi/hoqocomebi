The break up came shortly after it was revealed that the couple was dating.</p><p>The pair never confirmed that they were dating. However, paparazzi pictures of them made netizens believe they were together.</p><p>Five months after the rumors spread, fans and followers of Reinhart and Neville believe that the couple has parted ways for good.</p><p>Here is everything we know about the pair’s dating history and break up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lili Reinhart and her boyfriend, Spencer Neville</h2><p>While Reinhart and Neville did not officially reveal their relationship, Neville seemed to be a particular individual to attract the actress’ attention after her breakup from Cole Sprouse in 2020.</p><p>Reinhart and Neville became romantically connected after they were seen cuddling during Coachella’s first weekend on April 16, 2022. The duo was pictured looking comfy in one other’s arms at Paris Hilton’s “sliving” post-festival afterparty, Neon Carnival.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait whaaaaaat ?!?!?!<br>I'm so happy for her and I hope she will be so happy , she deserves every bit of it .<br>Lili Reinhart & Spencer Neville and so ready for it . <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qpnq9P7st3</a></p>— Doha (@lili_tomdaya) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 17, 2022</a></figure><p>Their festival clothes were even identical. Reinhart donned a sheer pink and beige flowery top with face rhinestones, while the American Horror Story star wore a silk beige button-up shirt.</p><p>After the two were seen at Coachella, a source close to Reinhart revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> that she was casually dating Neville. The source confirmed that the Riverdale star was “really into” her new boyfriend.</p><p>They said, “They met through the industry and were introduced together by a few friends. Lili and Spencer spent the entire weekend together at Coachella and had a lot of fun.”</p><p>The source further told the tabloid that Neville was the first person Reinhart was into after breaking up with Sprouse. They continued, “Everyone around her says she seems very happy right now and her friends think Spencer is great.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>While Reinhart has not publicly addressed her dating status, she has said that she would want to be a mother in the future.</p><p>She talked about it in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>ExtraTV</a> in August 2022. In the interview, she hinted that she was single since she revealed that she was searching for a baby daddy.</p><p>She said, “Gotta find a baby daddy first.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The break up</h2><p>Several fans noticed that Reinhart and Neville had stopped following each other on Instagram in late August 2022.</p><p>Following and unfollowing on social media is one of the most significant markers of what is going on in celebrities’ personal life, and keen users regularly study their online imprint.</p><p>Most of the time, when celebrity couples unfollow each other on the platform, it means that they have gone through a break up. Therefore, it seems like Reinhart and Neville have parted ways for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/spen.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Deuxmoi confirmed that Lili Reinhart and her new boyfriend, Spencer Neville, had gone through a break up.

As a result, sports betting has grown to become one of the biggest industries on the internet. Sportsbooks are now making it safe for bettors to place wagers from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p>Even better, most of the major sportsbooks offer mobile-optimized sites or standalone apps. Mobile is the way to get online these days, which means that there are a number of benefits to doing your sports betting from your smart device.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ease</strong></h2><p>Let’s face facts: the single biggest benefit ofmobile <a href=# rel=noopener>sports betting in Arizona</a> is that you don’t have to be tied to a casino. Sure, most of the large sports betting brands out there have established websites and can be accessed from a desktop. But people are starting to convert to mobile browsing in nearly every way.</p><p>Being able to access a sports betting site through a mobile-optimized browser is a must. Many of the top brands also have a dedicated app for their sportsbooks, creating a seamless transition from the desktop site to the mobile version. Being able to simply tap a couple of times on a smartphone is a lot more convenient than having to fire up a computer at home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Safety</strong></h2><p>One of the most important things about<a href=#> betting on sports</a> is being safe while you do so. There are plenty of sites out there to choose from but the best of the best put a premium on a safe betting experience. Part of that also means being able to get in touch with reliable customer support when the time arises.</p><p>The best feature of most online sportsbooks is the 24/7 chat. This isn’t some<a href=# rel=noopener> AI chatbot</a> that attempts to answer questions through a series of prompts. Within minutes, it is possible to connect to a live customer service rep in an attempt to get the issue resolved. It is a must for online sportsbooks to make those potential hiccups go a lot smoother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stay on Top of the Action</strong></h2><p>An important development in the world of sports betting is the ability to bet on games that have already begun. It used to be pretty simple: get your bets in before the game starts or miss out entirely. For bettors, there was nothing worse than forgetting to place a bet and missing out after the game had already begun.</p><p>Thankfully, mobile sports betting and live in-game betting have made that a thing of the past. Instead of having to worry about getting home to place your bets, you can do it on the go. Forgot about the big football game? You can still get bets in at just about any point during the action. It has been a game-changer for bettors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2><p>Bonuses are one of the most important aspects of playing at an online sportsbook. Each one has its own bonus, a way to entice players to choose that sportsbook. Whether it be free bets, a risk-free first bet, or something else entirely, choosing one is a critical part of getting started.</p><p>Some sportsbooks even have mobile-specific bonuses. Whether that be playing at a mobile-optimized site or downloading the app, there could be potential bonuses to take advantage of. It’s quick, easy, and doesn’t really require much else from the user.</p><p>There are even more reasons why mobile sports betting has taken over. As we continue to see mobile-facing platforms, the importance of mobile sports betting will only increase. There was once a time when mobile was considered to be the future. Well, the future has arrived.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">What Do You Mean By Two Pair In Poker?</h1><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pokies.jpg alt="What Do You Mean By Two Pair In Poker?" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Poker is a popular card game that uses a standard 52-card deck. Poker hands are ranked based on certain combinations of cards. ‘Two pair’ is one such poker hand comprising two sets of pairs and a 5th odd card. Let’s understand this common poker sequence in more detail.</p><p>Two-pair is a frequently occurring hand in poker games. It is stronger than one pair but weaker than three-of-a-kind and straight. As the name suggests, two pairs means having two different pairs of cards in a 5-card poker hand.</p><p>Mastering the <a href=# rel=noopener>poker sequence</a> not only helps players rank their own hands properly in comparison to others, but also gives them a better understanding of the odds and probabilities involved in the game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Probability and strategic play</strong></h2><p>As only 12 cards out of 52 can possibly build two-pair hands, the odds of being dealt two-pair pre-flop are around 4.75%. This makes it less common than one pair but significantly higher than three-of-a-kind or better.</p><p>When dealt medium-high two pairs, going aggressively for a raise to win the pot is a good opportunistic strategy. But surrender a decent two pairs to excessive action since opponents likely have stronger triplets or full houses. Mastering this balance between value betting and disciplined folds is key.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Playing two pairs by position</strong></h2><p>Your position at the poker table also affects the two-pair strategy. For instance, in Texas Hold’em, being in an early position like UTG (under the gun) over the flop, check-calling is often safer than betting out. This allows you to keep the pot small and not face exploratory raises without clarity on board strength. Conversely, betting two pairs in late position, like on the button, exploits fold equity by pressuring opponents yet to act after you. Understanding positional leverage is vital while playing two-pair poker hands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Relative Value of Two Pairs</strong></h2><p>It is also important to assess two-pair strength relative to the community cards and number of players in hand. Having the top two pairs on a low board is strong, as opponents cannot have straights or flushes. But middle/bottom two pairs on rainbow boards 3-bet pre-flop indicate danger. Similarly, multi-way action in a pot often demands stronger hands, so decisions should adapt contextually. Mastering these dynamics improves two-pair profitability significantly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Extracting Max Value</strong></h2><p>To maximize value from two pairs, allowing opponents to catch the second pair hands on the turn or river and then targeting them for bets is highly rewarding. Slow-playing monsters like nut flushes and full houses also pay off well against two pairs by sucking out at showdown. Hence, besides playing two pairs fast earlier, different speeds on later streets based on scenarios optimize profits despite the volatility.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Whether you’re a beginner just learning the ropes or a seasoned pro, there’s a <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>poker game download</strong></a><strong> </strong>suited to your needs. Knowing its ranking versus other hands guides expectation-setting. Adapting betting, check-calling, and fold frequencies by position and situation while leveraging their disguise potential allows for optimizing profits.</p><p>Two-pair bluffs also make profitable semi-bluffs when additional outs remain. So do leverage its dynamics, but guard against getting outdrawn given its limitations too. Mastering these intricacies will make two pairs a consistent winner for your poker bottom line.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Zak Bagans Isn’t Married but Has a Girlfriend Holly Madison — They Rekindled Their Romance</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Zak Bagans isn’t married but isn’t single too.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Zak-Bagans-Wife-1.jpg alt="Zak Bagans Isn’t Married but Has a Girlfriend Holly Madison — They Rekindled Their Romance" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Zak Bagans is not <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">married</a> but is currently in a relationship. The notable paranormal investigator and television personality has been romantically involved with Holly Madison.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite a brief separation in 2021, the couple has officially rekindled their romance, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>. The sources close to them revealed that the split was amicable, and Bagans and Madison have remained in contact since then.</p><p>Their connection, which began after Madison visited Bagans’ Haunted Museum in Las Vegas in May 2019, seems to have endured the test of time and distance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Zak Bagans and his girlfriend Holly Madison. (Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>)</p><p>Madison, who travels between Los Angeles and Vegas due to her kids, and Bagans, who travels extensively for the filming of his show, manage to spend time together almost every week.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being public figures, the couple has chosen to keep their relationship relatively private, rarely being photographed together. I</p><p>That being said, Madison’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a>, where she wished Bagans a happy birthday with a photo of a clown birthday cake, provided a glimpse into their intimate relationship.</p><p>Before dating Bagans, Madison was previously married to Pasquale Rotella until February 2019. They have two children together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zak Bagans’ ghost adventures</h2><p>Bagans collaborated with Nick Groff and Aaron Goodwin in 2004 to create a documentary-style film of&nbsp;Ghost Adventures, which ultimately aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>The success of the film paved the way for a full-fledged series that premiered in 2008 on the Travel Channel, marking the beginning of a captivating journey through haunted locations.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its popularity,&nbsp;Ghost Adventures&nbsp;and other ghost hunting shows have faced criticism and accusations of fakery. Bagans, however, has continued to lead investigations and explore the unexplained.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In addition to&nbsp;Ghost Adventures, Bagans ventured into a spin-off series titled&nbsp;Ghost Adventures: Aftershocks&nbsp;from 2014 to 2016. The show delved into the aftermath of prior&nbsp;Ghost Adventures&nbsp;investigations, focusing on the impact and changes experienced by individuals involved in the paranormal encounters.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Bagans’ paranormal journey is his alleged communication with the late actor David Strickland, known for his role in NBC’s&nbsp;Suddenly Susan.&nbsp;</p><p>Strickland’s tragic suicide in 1999 at the Oasis Motel in Las Vegas became a focal point for Bagans, who claims to have recorded Strickland’s voice almost a decade after his death. This recording found its way into a track on Bagans’ album&nbsp;NecroFusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, no known scientific analysis has been conducted on the raw recording, leaving questions about the veracity of Electronic Voice Phenomena and its connection to the famous actor unanswered.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zak Bagans’ other projects</h2><p>Bagans, known for his paranormal investigations on the hit show&nbsp;Ghost Adventures, has extended his passion for the supernatural into various other projects.&nbsp;</p><p>One notable venture is the creation of a “haunted museum” in Las Vegas, Nevada, as depicted in the Travel Channel series&nbsp;Deadly Possessions, which premiered on April 2, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>The show captured Bagans’ quest to procure items with haunted histories, eventually culminating in the opening of the museum to the public in October 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The museum boasts 33 rooms, each showcasing an array of intriguing and eerie artifacts. Among the notable items on display are Bela Lugosi’s mirror, the infamous Dybbuk box, Peggy the Doll, and even Jack Kevorkian’s chilling “Death Van.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, some controversy surrounds certain claims attached to these artifacts, with skepticism raised about the provenance of items like the Lugosi mirror and Captain Smith mirror housed in the museum.</p><p>Despite the controversies, the museum earned recognition in 2018 when it received the Las Vegas Mayor’s award for historic preservation and adaptive reuse.&nbsp;</p><p>In a fascinating addition to the museum’s collection in 2021, the transaxle salvaged from the Porsche 550 Spyder of American actor James Dean found its place among the eerie artifacts.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Bagans announced in May 2021 that he would be hosting and executive producing&nbsp;The Haunted Museum, a horror anthology show set to be broadcast on the Discovery+ Channel.&nbsp;</p><p>The series, filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Toronto, Canada by Cream Productions, features Eli Roth as a filmmaker and Matt Booi, Kate Harrison Karman, and David Brady as executive producers.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the museum also houses a large painting of P.T. Barnum, a figure whom Bagans is said to idolize. This addition further reflects Bagans’ eclectic taste in curating a collection that spans not only the supernatural but also historical and cultural dimensions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zak Bagans also has written books</h2><p>Bagans has also made significant contributions to the literary world. Collaborating with author Kelly Crigger, Bagans co-wrote the book&nbsp;Dark World: Into the Shadows&nbsp;with the Lead Investigator of the Ghost Adventures Crew.&nbsp;</p><p>This collaboration proved to be a literary success, as the book made its debut on The New York Times Best Seller list at No. 18 on September 23, 2011.</p><p>In December 2019, Bagans expanded his literary repertoire with the publication of&nbsp;Ghost-Hunting For Dummies, a book that delves into the history of ghost-hunting.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond a mere historical account, the book draws on Bagans’ own experiences, featuring true accounts and stories from his famous cases and investigations. It aims to guide readers on how to embark on their supernatural investigations, inviting them to explore the unexplained.</p><p>However, the reception of&nbsp;Ghost-Hunting For Dummies&nbsp;was not without its critiques. Paranormal investigator Kenneth Biddle, writing for Skeptical Inquirer magazine, noted Bagans’ apparent bias against skeptics and scientists throughout much of the book.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57z6inrqSRp3yttcuiZKudmaO1or7TZqqpnZ6YsrN5zZ6toqScmnqjvsSaoq6o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emily-maynard-gives-birth-welcomes-baby-boy-with-husband-first-photo-2015167.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Maynard Gives Birth, Welcomes Baby Boy With Husband: First Photo">&larr;
