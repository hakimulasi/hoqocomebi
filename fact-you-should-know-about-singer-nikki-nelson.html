Nelson found herself in the contender place for <i>Highway 101</i>'s lead singer while she was working as a waitress at the <i>Nashville Palace</i>.</p><p>The singer went through some ups and downs with the band; she also tried to go solo and again returned to perform with the group. During her career, which started in 1991, the singer has gained a lot of fame among the country music fans. Now, if you want to know more about her, especially about her relationship status, then read along.</p><h2>The Tennessee-based Singer worked as a Waitress</h2><p>Nikki showed some courage and moved from her house in Carson City to make her name in the music industry. In an interview, Ms. Nelson said, the move away from home was terrifying. She further said,</p><p>"But I knew that's what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be".</p><p>With that motto, she created her songs, which in some way made its' way to <strong>Martha Sharpe</strong>. Martha worked for <i>Warner Bros.</i> in Nashville. She took the track to <i>Highway 101</i>'s band members. They immediately asked Nelson to be their lead singer as they were looking for one after <strong>Paulette Carlson</strong> left the band.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/18/hqdefault-1574060103159.jpg><p>Before this, she served as a waitress at the <i>Nashville Palace,</i> where another country superstar <strong>Randy Travis</strong> also worked as a dishwasher. The destiny for Nikki changed with that proposal, and she quickly gained a lot of fame.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nikki also went Solo</h2><p>In 1995, almost five years together with the band, Ms. Nelson signed a solo recording deal with <i>Columbia Records</i>. After going solo in her career, Nikki left the band, and <strong>Chrislynn Lee</strong> grabbed the opportunity to be the band's lead singer.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Nelson's solo career took off with singles like "Too Little Too Much" and "I Don't Know How Not to Love You." On <i>Hot Country Songs charts</i>, Nikki's single charted at No. 62. With almost a decade long solo career, Nelson returned to her band members in 2006.</p><h2>Was She Ever Married?</h2><p>As far as the online reports go, the country music singer is still single. There are no pieces of evidence to suggest that the singer found the right man and started the family. In many reports, Nikki always goes by the name Ms. Nelson, which gives us a clue that she is not married yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/18/d5d96844009b4226a74a8429544264c7-1574060340834.jpg><p>As of now, the singer is fifty years old, and she might find the right guy in the coming future. Nikki is very secretive when it comes to her personal life, and not like other singers such as <a href=#><strong>Stevie Wonder</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blaire Hanks</strong></a>. Nelson does not use any social media platforms, which makes it very difficult to find out about her status.&nbsp;</p><h2>Critics Slammed Highway 101 for its' Mindless Chatter</h2><p>Just after nine months of Nelson joining the band, <a href=#><strong>Critics slammed the group for its' mindless chatter.</strong></a> The article says, the group stopped producing high-quality content and instead of carrying sour-humored running jokes.</p><p>The critic, however, went a little lose on Nelson as she is the newest member of the band. They also claimed why Carlson, the lead singer before Nelson left the band. It was because of this lame banter. But to prove the critics wrong, the later years of the group with Nikki went very good.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>They came out with outstanding tracks, which became a huge hit. The band, along with Nikki, performed at many live shows till 1995, after which Nelson left the band to pursue her solo career.</p><p><i><strong>For further updates, stay tuned to </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i> &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp%2BYnKxdrry2edKhpq6klGK4r7vWZpibp6WperS1zaCcq2WenristYynnKWrn6M%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./weezer-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Weezer Net Worth 2024">&larr;
