Who Timothée has dated or dated before? Honestly have no clue. That couldn’t continue. We, the people (of whom I am a part), must know immediately who Timothée Chalamet is dating.</p><p>Timothée Chalamet, who first came to prominence in 2017 as Elio in Call Me By Your Name, has swiftly become one of Hollywood’s most attractive bachelors because of his lovely dimples, perfectly wavy brown curls, and smart red-carpet looks.</p><p><strong>Let’s go back to the baby for a moment:</strong></p><p>Dune actor Timothée Chalamet appears to be single at the moment (and waiting till he meets you, obviously), so let’s look back at his exes from 2013 to the present.</p><h2>Lourdes Leon (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Lourdes-Leon.jpg><p>In 2013, Timothée Chalamet was a junior at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City. What kind of a girlfriend does he have? Lourdes Leon, Madonna’s daughter, of course!</p><p>Timothée sounded a little self-conscious about discussing the Material Girl designer during an interview with Andy Cohen for the film Call Me by Your Name in 2017.</p><p>She hasn’t seen it yet, but he said she’s looking forward to it. “She makes fun of me for all my public outings… She is thrilled about the film and thinks its positive response speaks volumes. It’s similar to the late-night activities I’ve engaged in that required me to make public appearances. I’m constantly the object of ridicule.</p><p>Although the young couple broke up in 2017, it appears that they remain friendly and speak highly of each other. Lourdes remarked of him in a 2021 interview, “I respect him a lot; we were a little thing.” “This is my very first…relationship.”</p><p>Are you also interested in knowing about the youtube star <a href=# rel=noopener>Lexi River Dating</a> details?</p><h2>Lily-Rose Depp From 2018-2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Lily-Rose.jpg><p>Iconic Hollywood couple: the co-stars. On The King for<a href=# rel=noopener> Netflix</a> set, Timothée met Lily-Rose Depp (yes, THAT Johnny Depp’s daughter). Three months after filming concluded, admirers spotted the two at a New York City café, sparking relationship speculations. A month later, in October 2018, their relationship status was verified when they were caught kissing in public. During his 2019 Golden Globes interview, Timothée deftly sidestepped any inquiry concerning<a href=# rel=noopener> Johnny Depp</a>.</p><p>Beginning in early September of 2019, the twosome traveled to Venice, Italy, for The King’s world premiere. Promoting their film, the couple was spotted canoodling heavily on a boat with their buddies while in Capri. Here, we refer to those images in question. There was an immediate uproar on the web.</p><p>Timothée said he felt humiliated upon seeing the images. In October that year, he told GQ, “I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life.” While spending the day on a boat with the person I love the most, I closed my eyes and thought, “That was fantastic.”</p><p>And then to wake up, see these photographs, and feel ashamed and like a complete snob? Is everyone pale? And then they say, “This is a PR stunt,” or anything of that effect. What, a public relations gimmick? Honestly, do you think I’d want to present that image to you?</p><p>However, the relationship had already terminated when the words were published. Timothée had previously characterized himself as “single” in an interview with British Vogue in May 2020.</p><h2>Eiza González June 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Eiza-Gonzalez.jpg><p>Although neither party has ever come out and said so publicly, it appears clear that Timmy and Baby Driver’s Eiza González were romantically involved. In the months following his divorce from Depp, pictures of him and his new girlfriend kissing and hanging out by a pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, surfaced in the media throughout the summer.</p><h2>Lily-Rose Depp 2021</h2><p>They can’t seem to stay away from each other! The speculations (and hopes) that they were back together were fanned by reports of sightings of the duo, but these sightings were never substantiated.</p><p>They published a photo of Timmy and Lily purportedly reuniting in June 2021; we have heard nothing more about the rumored couple’s reunion.</p><h2>Sarah Talabi in April 2022</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Sarah-Talabi.jpg><p>Okay, folks, here’s some up-to-date dating information from Chalamet that will shatter your hearts. And man, this is one crazy journey.</p><p>An April 18 post on <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> and Instagram of Timothée Chalamet dancing with Nigerian beauty and novelist Sarah Talabi from Coachella 2022 set social media on fire. Well-known Instagram celebrities are a hot topic of conversation. Timothee Chalamet and Victoria’s Secret model Sarah Talabi were reportedly spotted dancing and kissing at Coachella, according to a tip posted on Deux Moi.</p><p>You can also read about who is<a href=# rel=noopener> Venus William dating</a>?
