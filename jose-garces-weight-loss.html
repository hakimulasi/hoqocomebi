Garces received instruction from Stephen Starr on how to construct an empire from him.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Amada, Chifa, Village Whiskey, Garces Trading Co., JG Domestic, Mercat, Distrito, and Tinto are all restaurants that are part of the Garces Restaurant Group, which Garces went on to build after he had already established himself as a successful restaurateur.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The first of the lot, Amada, has received the most acclaim and has been published in publications such as Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, the New York Times, and Gourmet.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Jose Garces (@chefjosegarces)</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jose_Garces_How_Did_He_Lose_Weight></span>Jose Garces: How Did He Lose Weight?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>José Garces has shed roughly 5 pounds of his weight when he started consuming healthier foods.

The recipe has also affected his cooking technique and led him to merge his decades of culinary knowledge with plant-forward dishes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Looking at an old image of him reveals that he has shed a respectable amount of weight over the course of several years. The fact that he incorporated nutritious dishes into his regular diet is the primary reason for his physically fit appearance.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Because of his wide and varied involvement in the culinary world, Chef Garces has amassed a sizable collection of one-of-a-kind recipe ideas, which he has developed thanks to the fact that food has taken him all over the world.</p><p style=text-align:justify>These recipes for adding a healthy spin to tasty food have assisted him, as well as a lot of his other followers, in shedding excess weight.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The stress that he experienced as a direct result of the shutting of these three restaurants has also been linked to his weight loss. Three of his sixteen restaurants were forced to declare bankruptcy due to financial difficulties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jose-Garces-min-2-300x252.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jose_Garces_Culinary_Arts_School></span>Jose Garces: Culinary Arts School<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jose Garces, owner of restaurants in Philadelphia and Philadelphia’s Iron Chef, learned to cook alongside his mother and father when he was a child.<span id=easy-footnote-3-28935 class=easy-footnote-margin-adjust></span><span class=easy-footnote><a href=# title='a href="https://www.mashed.com/628175/the-untold-truth-of-iron-chef-jose-garces/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"mashed/a'>3</a></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>He eventually decided to get a formal education in cooking after spending two years taking business classes at a community college in Chicago and finding them uninteresting.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Garces informed ABC News that she received her training in the culinary arts from Kendall College in Chicago. “Then it dawned on me, and I thought, “Whoa, there are a ton of opportunities here, and this could be a lot of fun,” and then the light shut out again. That was essentially all there was to it.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>After receiving his diploma from Kendall, Garces made the decision to launch his professional cooking career in a larger metropolis and consequently relocated to New York.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to an interview, one of his first jobs in the culinary industry was working the line at the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Plaza. He described this experience as a “sweaty” introduction to the world of cooking.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He told, “I remember having to change my clothes after two hours of being on the line because I had sweated them all the way through.” “I remember having to change my clothes after two hours of being on the line.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Well that was enlightening to say the least.
