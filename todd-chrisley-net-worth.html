Todd Chrisley became nationally famous thanks to the USA Network reality series, "Chrisley Knows Best." The show follows Mr. Chrisley and his family as they go about their daily lives. A spin-off show focusing on Todd's children Chase and Savannah called "Growing Up Chrisley," premiered on April 2, 2019.</p><h2 id=arrest-conviction-tldr><strong>Arrest and Conviction: TLDR</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, in recent years Todd and his wife Julie earned an additional level of infamy after they were convicted on tax and fraud crimes. In 2019 Todd, Julie and an accountant were indicted by a grand jury on wire fraud and tax charges. The Chrisleys were accused of defrauding banks of $36 million using false bank statements, inflated personal financial statements and fake audits. The Chrisleys then allegedly used those funds to fund an extremely lavish lifestyle while not paying taxes. At one point Todd filed for bankruptcy so he could away from approximately $20 million worth of the debt.</p><p>According to the DOJ:</p><p>"<strong>The Chrisleys spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel â€” and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones. After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans.</strong>"</p><p>Their trial began in May 2022. It lasted six weeks. Todd and Julie were convicted in June 2022. On November 21, 2022 Todd Chrisley was sentenced to serve 12 years in prison related to his conviction. Julie was sentenced to serve 7 years. They will both serve three years of probation after their prison sentences.</p><p>At sentencing, prosecutors described the Todd and Julie as such:</p><p>"<strong>The Chrisleys have built an empire based on the lie that their wealth came from dedication and hard work. The jury's unanimous verdict sets the record straight: Todd and Julie Chrisley are career swindlers who have made a living by jumping from one fraud scheme to another, lying to banks, stiffing vendors and evading taxes at every corner.</strong>"</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-340920 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/todd-chrisley-1.jpg alt="Todd Chrisley Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-340920 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Noel Vasquez/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=chrisley-asset-management><strong>Chrisley Asset Management</strong></h2><p>At one point Todd Chrisley owned and operated Chrisley Asset Management, a firm that, according to court documents, had been struggling for a number of years, even as Mr. Chrisley and family continued to live a very lavish lifestyle. A lifestyle that included owning a 30,000-square-foot mansion and spending $300,000 per year on clothes.</p><p>Chrisley Asset Management would later play a starring role in Todd and Julie's legal troubles.</p><h2 id=august-2019-arrest><strong>August 2019 Arrest</strong></h2><p>On August 14, 2019, Todd and <a href=#>Julie Chrisley</a> were arrested in Atlanta on a multi-count indictment. The initial charges included tax evasion, wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy. According to the indictment, between approximately 2007 and 2012, Todd and Julie allegedly used Chrisley Asset Management to seek $36 million worth of bank loans which would be used to buy and sell foreclosed properties. Prosecutors alleged that the couple provided false information to secure these bank loans. That false information allegedly drastically inflated the couple's net worth.</p><p>According to the indictment, Todd and Julie:</p><p>"<strong>Conspired to submit false materials, such as fabricated bank statements and false personal financial statements, to financial institutions to obtain millions of dollars in loans, much of which they used for their own personal benefit.</strong>"</p><p>As one example, the indictment claims that in November 2007 Todd and Julie showed a bank a fabricated financial statement. From the indictment:</p><p>"<strong>When the bank employee requested account statements, Co-conspirator A [an employee apparently working for the Chrisleys] sent Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley a fabricated bank statement showing that Todd and Julie Chrisley had $776,509.52 on deposit at Merrill Lynch.</strong></p><p><strong>In response, Todd Chrisley told his co-conspirator, 'you are a f****** genious [sic]!!! Just make it show 4 mil+</strong>"</p><p>In reality, the couple did not have a Merrill Lynch bank account at that time. When they did have one a year later, it never contained more than $17,000.</p><p>Furthermore, Todd and Julie also allegedly dodged federal tax bills.</p><p>In their trial it was revealed that IRS agents took notice that the Chrisleys spent thousands of dollars on electronics during an episode of their reality show. At the same time, these very same Chrisleys were pleading poverty to the IRS.</p><p>Todd and Julie claimed in a social media post that the illegal acts were performed by a former "trusted employee" who stole from the family and carried out the crimes without their knowledge. They were forced to appear in court and post $100,000 in unsecured appearance bonds. They were also ordered to restrict their travel to Atlanta and California only if they are taping their TV show.</p><p>In February 2022 a new indictment was filed. In addition to the previously-mentioned charges of submitting fake documents when applying for loans, the indictment further accused the couple of using a film production company to hide $2 million worth of unpaid taxes owed to the IRS. That $2 million tax bill was allegedly related to earnings from their TV show which the couple allegedly hid in a production company they controlled called 7C's Productions.</p><p>In this updated indictment, Todd and Julie were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, one count of tax fraud and FIVE counts of bank fraud. They have pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Their Federal criminal trial began in May 2022. They were convicted in June 2022 and in November 2022 Todd and Julie were sentenced to 12 and 7 years in prison, respectively.</p><h2 id=bankruptcy-case><strong>Bankruptcy Case</strong></h2><p>Todd Chrisley was also at one point ensnared in a $45 million bankruptcy case involving his real estate empire. In a court proceeding, a trustee in the bankruptcy case claimed that Todd hid millions of dollars worth of assets in his wife's name. Chrisley's lawyer denied these allegations.</p><p>Todd Chrisley first filed for bankruptcy in 2012, at which point he claimed to have $4.2 million in assets and $50 million worth of debt. In the same filing, Todd claimed to only have $100 in cash and $55 in his checking account.</p><p>Chrisley Asset Management filed for corporate bankruptcy in 2013. His mortgage on the Atlanta mansion totaled $12 million and Todd reported nearly $600,000 in IRS late fees, debts, and penalties.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-147978 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/todd1.jpg alt="Todd Chrisley" width=409 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-147978 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Todd Chrisley was born on April 6, 1969, in Georgia. He grew up in Westminster, South Carolina.</p><h2 id=chrisley-knows-best><strong>Chrisley Knows Best</strong></h2><p>"Chrisley Knows Best" premiered in 2014 with an eight-episode first season. Todd instantly became infamous for his luxurious lifestyle based on materialism. Viewers were fascinated with his reckless and out of control spending. Todd and his wife have huge wardrobes of expensive designer clothes. They drive very expensive cars. They live in a mansion in Atlanta that spans 30,000 square feet. Chrisley is also fond of reminding people that his neighbors in his ultra-exclusive gated neighborhood are <a href=# title="Usher Net Worth">Usher</a> and MLB player <a href=# title="Chipper Jones Net Worth">Chipper Jones</a>.</p><p>Todd is known to be controlling and he has strict rules for raising his children. He closely monitors their usage of the internet and text messaging to keep them out of trouble, and also has tracking devices in their vehicles. In the first episode of "Chrisley Knows Best," Todd disabled his son Chase's car with a wheel clamp and steering-wheel lock after he snuck out to attend a high school football game.</p><p>In another memorable episode, Chrisley threw his son's laptop into the swimming pool. Why? He wanted to teach him a lesson. And lest you think these actions are exaggerated for the television cameras, Chrisley will disabuse you of this notion. In more than one interview, he has stressed that "Chrisley Knows Best" is an accurate presentation of his family's life.</p><p>As of this writing there have been more than 200 episodes of the show across nine seasons and counting. Several episodes from the previously-renewed 10th season were filmed prior to the trial and aired in 2023. The show is broadcast in the U.S. as well as in Canada, the U.K., Australia, and Asia. The show has led to a spinoff series featuring Chase and <a href=# title="Savannah Chrisley Net Worth">Savannah Chrisley</a>'s move from Nashville to Los Angeles called "Growing Up Chrisley."</p><p>On camera, Chrisley is all about his expensive lifestyle, especially his wardrobe of designer clothes. However, interestingly, in a bankruptcy filing, Chrisley claimed that his clothes were only worth $650.</p><p>In 2016, Chrisley released the country single, "Infinite Love," with <a href=# title="Sara Evans Net Worth">Sara Evans</a>. The song peaked at #19 on the Billboard Country Digital Singles chart.</p><p>In August 2017, USA Network&nbsp;announced that it had ordered a half-hour after-show called&nbsp;According to Chrisley. The talk show was hosted by Todd Chrisley and featured Todd "tackling the truth about marriage, parenting, sex, and relationships." Each episode also features a member of the Chrisley family, as well as a celebrity guest. The show premiered on September 12, 2017 and was canceled after one season.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296335 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Todd-Chrisley.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1184px) 100vw, 1184px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296335 class=wp-caption-text>Moses Robinson/Getty Images</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Todd Chrisley was married to Teresa Terry until 1996. They have two children, Lindsie and Kyle. The same year he divorced Teresa, he married former beauty pageant queen Julie Hughes, now known as Julie Chrisley. They have three children, Savannah, Chase, and Grayson. Julie is the daughter of a Baptist minister, Todd's business partner, and best friend.</p><p>Todd Chrisley is a germophobe and tries to avoid things like dirt and animals.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2015, Chrisley moved his family to Nashville, where there are no state income taxes, and bought a home for $1.6 million. In June 2019, the Chrisleys spent $3.4 million on a home just outside of Nashville. A mere two months later, amid their alleged financial crimes, they put the home on the market for $4.7 million. Both mansions, worth a combined $9 million or so today, may have to be sold off to pay restitution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvTqJudZZOdv6q%2Fy56wZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./influencer-vanessa-mancini-dead-41-massive-heart-attack-what-happened.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Mancini dead at 41 - what happened to popular influencer?">&larr;
