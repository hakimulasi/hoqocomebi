Tiffany’s lawyer, Andrew Brettler, indicated that the case is an extortion attempt, and the plaintiff’s mother, Trizah Morris, has been attempting to establish these charges against Haddish for years. Brettler continued,</p><p>“Every attorney who first took on the case – and there were many – eventually quit the case as it became evident that the accusations were without substance and Ms. Haddish would not be shaken down.” Ms. Morris is now represented in this action by her adult daughter. They will have to face the repercussions of their silly behavior jointly.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Aries Spears had a whole “skit” about sexually abusing a child and Tiffany Haddish be defending and doxxing folks on behalf of abusers so I believe these new allegations.</p><p>— Martin Luther Greens (@Blike_Dante) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 2, 2022</a></p><h2>Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears are Sued</h2><p>According to the complaint filed against Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears, the siblings’ family used to travel to the duo’s house for Christmas. Haddish divorced William Stewart in 2013, and the former allegedly gave Jane a spot in her commercial.&nbsp;Jane and her family were completely uninformed of the incident, but Haddish and Spears were well aware of it. Furthermore, Haddish allegedly had to teach Jane how to imitate f****tio for a play about youngsters bickering over a sub sandwich. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Jane stated:</p><p>“I attempted to emulate what they wanted, but it simply turned out really unpleasant.” When I exited the booth, I realized I hadn’t finished what they had asked of me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tiffany-Haddish-1.jpg alt="Tiffany Haddish" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jane was paid $100 and said that she did not tell her mother anything about what occurred during the filming. Haddish then contacted the brothers’ mother and informed her that she was interested in hiring her son John for a Nickelodeon sizzle reel. According to the complaint, Haddish and Spears assaulted John while shooting, and a video of the incident was shared on Funny Or Die and other sites.</p><p>A spokesman for Funny Or Die said that they would never disseminate such stuff and were not engaged in any way with the video. According to the spokesman, it was user-generated information that was removed in 2018. Jane and John said that their mother had previously attempted to arrange a $15,000 settlement with Aries for the video, but the siblings are now suing the couple for damages.</p><h2>All About Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears</h2><p>Tiffany Haddish rose to prominence after appearing in the sitcom The Carmichael Show, which was followed by the comedy flick Girls Trip.
