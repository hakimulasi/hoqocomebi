She was working at Radio City Music Hall in New York City when she was approached by the Brooklyn group TrackMasters to join the organization as their manager. She decided to accept the position, which would change the trajectory of her career. Through her position with TrackMasters, she met music executive <a href=# title="Chris Lighty Net Worth">Chris Lighty</a>. Together, in 1996, the two co-founded the music management company Violator.

However, Scott moved the show concept in another direction. She had noticed the popularity of female ensemble-driven shows at the time and thought it would be a good idea to focus the show on Jim Jones' girlfriend, <a href=# title="Chrissy Lampkin Net Worth">Chrissy Lampkin</a>, and her circle of friends. The resulting show, called "Love & Hip Hop," went on to become a huge success, with Scott acting as producer through Monami Productions.</p><p>The show has since spawned an entire media franchise and a variety of spin-off series like "Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta," "Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood," "Love & Hip Hop: Miami," "Chrissy & Mr. Jones," "K. Michelle: My Life," "<a href=# title="Stevie J Net Worth">Stevie J</a> & Joseline: Go Hollywood," and "Leave it to Stevie," all of which have been produced by Monami Productions.
