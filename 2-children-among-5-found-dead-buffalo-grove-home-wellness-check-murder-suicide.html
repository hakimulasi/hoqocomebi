Following a request for a wellness check on a woman, officers were sent to the residence at about 11:12 am, where they discovered five bodies. Their identities remain a secret.&nbsp;</p><p>The victims' ages, genders, potential connections to one another, causes of death, and the causes of all this have not been disclosed by the police. However, neighbors informed <a href=# rel=nofollow>WGN</a> that the house was occupied by a husband, a wife, a boy, and a girl who were in the first grade. According to Michelle, the neighbor, the family has lived in the house for roughly four years. Though police haven't revealed whether the dead were the residents or not.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Body of 9-year-old found in Florida lake 72 hours after he fell off pontoon boat and was hit by propeller</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'She was not a mother to him': Outrage as Quinton Simon's heartbreaking obituary calls Leilani 'survivor'</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>News Release | Buffalo Grove Police investigating incident on Acacia Terrace<br>At 11:12 a.m., Buffalo Grove police were dispatched to a single-family residence in the 2800 block of Acacia Terrace following a call for a wellbeing check on an adult female.

Police officers and hazmat teams were at the site quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Firefighters had a tough time entering the house because of a gas leak. Southwest Gas, a nearby utility, cut off service to the residents, and residents were instructed to leave their homes. Before a police investigation in the early afternoon could begin, a hazmat crew spent several hours looking into the house.</p><p>Phoenix Police Sgt Melissa Soliz informed the media during a press conference that two adults and three children had died "with apparent evidence of trauma." The victims' identities were kept a secret. A homicide inquiry has been launched by police. However, Soliz stated, "We do not believe that there is a suspect on the loose right now." In a statement to local media, Southwest Gas claimed that no leaks had been discovered in the region and added, "Our hearts are heavy with today's news and we are grateful for the quick response of first responders."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoal2Ytaq4w6ucp2WRoryvs4xuZJ%2BnpaOxbrDEmptmmqWbs6K4zmaeq6emmnqpu8yeZLCdnKG7pr%2FSZpqhnZOgeq7B0Z2cq2WjqraktcOe</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jordin-sparks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Download All Latest Jordin Sparks Songs, Best Albums, New &amp;amp; Old Dj Mix (2024)">&larr;
