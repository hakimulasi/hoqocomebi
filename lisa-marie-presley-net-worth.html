In 2005, a large portion of Elvis Presley Enterprises was sold for $100 million, but after taxes and other fees, Lisa netted around $40 million.</p><p>This amount dwindled due to excessive spending and other financial missteps, leading her to sue Siegel in later years.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u3b110ea83052612d5535a87b9b475b1b><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>John Farnham Net Worth 2024: Earnings, Real Estate, and Financial Success</span></a><h3><span id=Breakdown-of-Assets-and-Debts>Breakdown of Assets and Debts</span></h3><h4>Major Assets</h4><p>Lisa Marie owned several valuable assets, including a 15% stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises and the iconic Graceland mansion.</p><p>Graceland, visited by hundreds of thousands of fans annually, remained a significant asset but also required substantial upkeep.</p><h4>Debts and Financial Obligations</h4><p>Despite her valuable assets, Lisa Marie faced mounting debts.

Her marriages to Michael Jackson, Nicolas Cage, and Michael Lockwood all ended in divorce, with each separation bringing its own set of financial challenges.</p><h3><span id=Life-Insurance-Policies-and-Their-Role>Life Insurance Policies and Their Role</span></h3><p>Lisa Marie had three life insurance policies worth $35 million, which were designated for her daughters.</p><p>This payout significantly impacted her financial legacy, providing some relief to her estate and beneficiaries.</p><h3><span id=Impact-on-Family>Impact on Family</span></h3><p>After Lisa Marie’s death, her mother Priscilla and daughter Riley Keough were involved in managing and contesting aspects of her estate.</p><p>Despite legal disputes, Riley was eventually named the sole trustee, ensuring that her siblings would benefit from the estate once they came of age.</p><h2><span id=Social-media>Social media</span></h2><p>N/A</p><h2><span id=FAQs-about-Lisa-Marie-Presley>FAQs about Lisa Marie Presley</span></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rachelparris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FAQs-about-Lisa-Marie-Presley.jpg decoding=async alt="FAQs about Lisa Marie Presley" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span id=What-was-Lisa-Marie-Presley8217s-cause-of-death>What was Lisa Marie Presley’s cause of death?</span></h3><p>Lisa Marie Presley passed away on January 12, 2023, at the age of 54.
