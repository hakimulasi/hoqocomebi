The “On the Floor” singer was on her to her dance studio when she was approached by the paps and held nothing back.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a> below, J-Lo parks right in front of her dance studio and is approached by a paparazzo. After several attempts to get The Hustlers star’s attention, she fired back, “I don’t do this for you! Believe it or not, I’m just living my life.” On the way in to the studio, she yells, “Be grateful,” before she closes the door. The confrontation comes directly after reports that her husband, <a href=# id=auto-tag_ben-affleck data-tag=ben-affleck>Ben Affleck</a>, is annoyed by the paparazzi especially when they were in Paris for their honeymoon with their families.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jennifer-lopez-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ben-affleck-britney-spears-kiss.png><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>&nbsp;on August 11, 2022, that the&nbsp;Batman v.

It was just them.” The source continued, “Whether it was holding hands, a caress, touching one another on the back … they never let go of one another.
