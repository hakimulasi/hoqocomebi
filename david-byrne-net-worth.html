When Byrne was two, the family moved to Canada and settled in Hamilton, Ontario. They subsequently moved to the United States, where they made their residence in Arbutus, Maryland when Byrne was around eight. Growing up, Byrne learned how to play the guitar, violin, accordion, and harmonica.

He was subsequently in the music duo Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. For his higher education, Byrne went to the Rhode Island School of Design and the Maryland Institute College of Art.

The next year saw the release of the hit Talking Heads concert film "Stop Making Sense," directed by <a href=# title="Jonathan Demme Net Worth">Jonathan Demme</a>.

Six years later, he released his critically acclaimed tenth solo studio album, called "American Utopia."
