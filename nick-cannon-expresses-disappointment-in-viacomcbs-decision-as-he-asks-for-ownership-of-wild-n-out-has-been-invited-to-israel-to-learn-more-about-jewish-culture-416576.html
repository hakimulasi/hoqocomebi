Nick’s recount of what happened sounds quite different and although he accepts their decision he has a few demands.</p><p>In case you haven’t heard, the comedian made anti-Semitic comments when he referred to Black people being the ‘true Hebrews.’ While making his point, he explained made comments that referred to Jews as ‘animals’ and ‘savages.’</p><p>However, <a href=#>Nick</a> insists that the point of the educational conversation completely went over the powers-that-be’s head. He insisted that he wanted to start an open dialogue about the plights of both Jews and Blacks and how to bridge the gap so the two minority groups can team up for the greater good.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCqqhvZhlhg/</a></p><p>In a lengthy Facebook post, Nick explained that his conversation with the media conglomerate was none existent.</p><p>‘I was a member of the Viacom “Family” for over Twenty years. Since I was a minor, we worked together to make great positive entertainment and I was handed many opportunities that I am grateful for.’</p><p>He went on to detail the historical moves he’s made while being a part of the family who owns Nickelodeon, VH1, and MTV. <a href=#>Nick</a> also mentions where the disconnect was.</p><p>‘I don’t have to defend myself here, the proof is in the history. I believed that the corporation was becoming more progressive and willing to create helpful spaces and dialogue in these difficult and uncertain times of 2020. Instead they chose to recently ban all advertisement that supported George Floyd and Breonna Taylor who we are all still seeking justice for. I also went as far to reach out to Ms. Shari Redstone, the owner of Viacom, to have a conversation of reconciliation and actually apologize if I said anything that pained or hurt her or her community. Dead Silence! So that’s when I realized they don’t want a conversation or growth, they wanted to put the young negro in his place. They wanted to show me who is boss, hang me out to dry and make an example of anyone who says something they don’t agree with. But like the great Shirley Chisholm, “I am unbossed and unbought and unbothered”. I respectfully stepped away from oppressive corporations in the past. NBC threatened and mistreated me for years, but I was the bigger person and abandoned an 8-figure salary on their number one hit show “Americas Got Talent” and currently stand by my friend and Queen Gabrielle Union in her fight against oppression.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCq2x5nhPdT/</a></p><p>He went on to say, regardless of what happened — he won’t stay down for long.</p><p>‘My hope and original goal was to use this moment to show healing and acceptance and prayed that Viacom would use their powers for good. Instead I am now receiving death threats, hate messages calling me an ungrateful N***** and beyond. Viacom’s goal to keep me from providing for my family and lineage will be foiled. They can try to kick me while I’m down or force me to kiss the master’s feet in public for shame and ridicule, but instead I stand firm on my square with my fist in the air repeating my mantra, “You can’t fire a Boss!”’</p><p>One great thing did come from this scandal — he has been invited to Israel from people who are interested in showing him the history of the country.</p><p>‘He [Michael Goldman] and so many gracious people from the Jewish Community are showering me with love and helping to guide me to the Promise land, literally l am excited to announce that I have been invited to Israel which is a lifelong dream where I will receive teachings, lessons and truth about the Jewish history. As someone who is in pursuit for my PHD in Theology and Divinity and just received a degree in Criminal Justice from the Great Howard University, this will be an enriching, enlightening and overall exciting trip!’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Cannon’s demand is that he wants full ownership of Wild N Out and its brands. He also would like an apology.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeenrCsecKapaennmKyubzRnqqsnaNisaq%2FwKmnqKGeqbqmutNmoKdlpp6upLvMnJmsZZSasKq%2FyKilZpmjYrWmecCsoqxllqS%2FbrvWp5yrq5ievW67xWauoqSUYrtuu9StZKGZo2KvprHNZqCnrpmpsqV506hkoquilrKtedOoZKWdkae7brnOq5xmmZKkwrV5yZ6uoquYYrC2uNOuqZ5lZGaDdoOVaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alex-lawther-net-worth-124578.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Lawther Net Worth">&larr;
