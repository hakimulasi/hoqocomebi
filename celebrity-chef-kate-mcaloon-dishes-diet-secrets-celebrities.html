She started her stint as a celebrity chef in 2005 and hasn’t looked back since then.</p><p>Here, you can know about the crucial diet secrets of celebrities that she witnessed first-hand and get a real sense of how those celebs eat in day-to-day lives.</p><h3><strong>The Beginning</strong></h3><p>In 2005, she was in Hawaii when someone told her that there were people who were looking to hire someone for three weeks. These people turned out to be a celebrity couple, Parks and Recreation&nbsp;(2009-2015) star <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nick Offerman</a> and his wife as well as Will and Grace&nbsp;(1998-Present) actress <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Megan Mullally</a>. They needed a chef urgently as their chef was leaving. They knew about McAloon, so they hired her.</p><h3><strong>The Second Celebrity Job</strong></h3><p>After the successful first stint as a celebrity chef, she was recommended by Mullally to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Courtney Cox</a>. She cooked for Cox and her then-husband <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>David Arquette</a>. This job lasted for about four years.</p><p>While working there, she used to prepare a lot of food on Sundays as they had to have loads of people, from 15 to 50 at their home at once. Whatever the number, the talented chef always prepared terrific meals as she was told of the plans in advance.</p><h3><strong>A Small Mistake</strong></h3><p>Once, Kate accidentally put olive oil rather than tequila in Courtney’s margaritas, but she realized the mistake soon and rectified it. Otherwise, it could have been a huge blunder.</p><h3><strong>Secrets of Success</strong></h3><p>The author of The Flavor of Joy&nbsp;(2017) says that the reason for her success is that she cooks food that’s not only healthy but tastes good as well. She is also calm in pressure situations like when plans change at the last minute, and she has no problem with meeting the unusual diet demands of a celebrity. She can make any food in any quantity for any celebrity if she knows of the plans in advance.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets of Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom</strong></h3><p>When working for one of her most significant A-list clients, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Miranda Kerr</a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Orlando Bloom</a>, she felt comfortable as Miranda used to talk about every expectation and be consistent about it.</p><p>The Australian model follows the diet she shares with fans. The couple loved light chicken, curries with coconut, salmon, quinoa, and vegetables she cooked for them. Kerr avoids foods with chemicals, has eliminated rice and abides by the 80/20 rule.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin</strong></h3><p>The American Celebrity Chef also cooked for <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Chris Martin</a>. They were married for 10 years, but they decided to split ways in 2014. Their diet was very strict as they ate nothing (almost!), were strict about food and avoided foods such as dairy foods, sugars, sweets, etc. They just stuck with loads of vegetables.</p><p>When she added more ingredients in their restricted foods, they appreciated her cooking skills and said that she had improved. In her opinion, that happens when a person eats more than grass.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets of Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw</strong></h3><p>Talking about the diet secrets of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Steven Spielberg</a> and Kate Capshaw, the ambassador for Young Living said that Kate was amazing and Steven had an excellent kitchen. The duo loves to cook, a lot.</p><p>While working for them, she accidentally chipped a piece of their stunning counter-top and was expecting to be fired which made her cry. But Kate told her not to worry about it and also mentioned that she loved her food. She felt immense relief when she was allowed to keep on working for the fabulous couple.</p><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Kate McAloon / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1xYycn56eXaCutbGMppqapJ%2Bku26wyKyfnqtdmbamwIysnJyqlanAbq%2FEpZybqpmptqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fia-fischler-height-age-who-family-biography-wiki-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fia Fischler Height, Age, Who, Family, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth">&larr;
