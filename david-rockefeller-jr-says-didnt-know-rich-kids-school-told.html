Considering that, it's amusing to find out that according to <a href=#>John D's</a> now-past-70-years-old great grandson,&nbsp;<a href=#>David Rockefeller Jr</a>., he made it to school age, before he really knew he was part of the famously wealthy family. He recently told CNBC:</p><p>"I actually had other people in school telling me I was a wealthy person. I didn't know my family was wealthyâ€¦ I didn't personally feel rich, so I disagreed with them."</p><p>That probably had a lot to do with the assumption made by most kids that everybody lives the same way they do, but despite the privilege that Rockefeller grew up in (both the Upper East Side townhouse and the Westchester County country house he called home as a child, were also home to the family's famous collection of priceless art and antiques), the Rockefellers still took a modest approach to their own wealth. They gave a lot of money to various charitable causes, and sought to raise the younger Rockefellers to value a dollar, in part with small weekly allowances. David Jr. recalls:</p><p>"Like a lot of other boys, I'd be buying baseball cards and bubble gum, things like that."</p><p>"I had classmates that might not have had as much money in their family as we did but who were spending a whole lot more money. I remember we were gasping at a friend, when I was 12, who took a girl out to dinner and spent $50. We were thinking, 'Oh my god.'"</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-256451 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-151869035.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-256451 class=wp-caption-text>Anna Webber/Getty Images</p><p>Now, David sees real value in the way he was brought up, and that it kept him from falling into the entitlement pitfalls that young rich kids sometimes find themselves in:</p><p>"I think it's very important, that you not get use to going first class when you're a kid, because otherwise you don't learn the value of not having that. And I think that was part of the teaching. Our parents could have given us a lot more and we would have been spoiled and we would not have learned."</p><p>In addition to being the great-grandson of John D Rockefeller, the United States' first billionaire, <a href=# title="David Rockefeller Net Worth">David Rockefeller</a> Jr. is now chairman of&nbsp;Rockefeller & Co., which purportedly seeks to continue John D's philosophy towards wealth and charity to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfma63tcNmqaibm5qzprjLnqlmoqJiwKLF0mabopyeqXqsus6wZKuhk516rLXDrGSsm5ikvK1506ijnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./diplo-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diplo Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
