It aired on E! network for four seasons, and centered on a fictional modern day British royal family.

E! canceled the series in August 2018, and as the production house failed to find a new network for the fifth season, it was announced that the show had officially ended.</p><h2><span id=Other_credits>Other credits</span></h2><p>William had the voiceover role of Peter Pevensie, in two video games based on “The Chronicles of Narnia” – “The Chronicles of Narnia” (2005), and “Prince Caspian” (2008).</p><p>In 2021, William starred as the main character in the music video for “Long Time Friends” by the Israeli-American duo The Living Tombstone.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_relationships>Love life and relationships</span></h2><p>William has been in four relationships that the public knows of.
