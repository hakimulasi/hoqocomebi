Some of the allegations included locking their son Chad in the basement for months as punishment, forcing their daughter Shari to give up her college fund to pay for a family vacation, neglecting their son Russell’s medical needs, and making their children sleep on bean bags instead of beds.</p><p>The channel was deleted by YouTube in 2020 after an investigation by the platform.

Her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, who is the founder of a parent counseling service called ConneXions, was also arrested on the same charges.</p><p>According to the arrest record obtained by Page Six , a child fled through a window of Hildebrandt’s house in Ivins and asked a neighbor for food and water. The neighbor noticed duct tape around the child’s ankles and wrists and called the police. The police found the child to be “emaciated and malnourished” and transported them to Saint George Regional Hospital. The child had deep lacerations from being tied up with rope.</p><p>Another allegedly malnourished child was discovered shortly thereafter and was also taken to the hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-Franke-wife-Ruby-Franke-arrested-for-child-abuse.jpg><p>The police report stated that Ruby had filmed a video in Hildebrandt’s home just days before the incident, indicating that she had “knowledge of the abuse, malnourishment and neglect”.</p><p>Ruby declined to speak to authorities and requested a lawyer. She is being held in Washington County jail without bail.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kevin_Frankes_Reaction_and_Current_Situation></span><strong>Kevin Franke’s Reaction and Current Situation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following Ruby’s arrest, Kevin’s attorney, Randy S. Kester, told Page Six that his client’s “urgent focus is simply to keep his children together under his fatherly care”. The other Franke kids remain in the care of the Department of Child and Family Services.</p><p>Kevin has not commented publicly on his wife’s arrest or the allegations against her.</p><p>His estranged daughter, Shari, who moved out of the family home earlier this year, took to Instagram to say that she and her family “are so glad that justice is being served”, claiming they have “been trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Ruby’s sisters also issued a joint statement that said the two arrests “needed to happen”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frequently_Asked_QA></span><strong>Frequently Asked Q/A</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li id=faq-question-1693571792416 class=rank-math-list-item><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Kevin_Franke></span><strong>How old is Kevin Franke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kevin Franke is 44 years old as of September 1, 2023.</p></li><li id=faq-question-1693571799529 class=rank-math-list-item><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Kevin_Franke_do_for_a_living></span><strong>What does Kevin Franke do for a living?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kevin Franke is an assistant professor of civil engineering at BYU.</p></li><li id=faq-question-1693571849772 class=rank-math-list-item><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_children_does_Kevin_Franke_have></span><strong>How many children does Kevin Franke have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kevin Franke has six children with his wife Ruby Franke: Shari, Chad, Abby, Julie, Russell, and Eve.</p></li><li id=faq-question-1693571890186 class=rank-math-list-item><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Kevin_Franke_arrested_for_child_abuse></span><strong>Is Kevin Franke arrested for child abuse?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>No, Kevin Franke is not arrested for child abuse.
