She developed a passion for acting at an early age and enrolled in the Conservatoire National Supérieur d’Art Dramatique (CNSAD), the prestigious national drama school in Paris. She made her film debut in 1981, in the comedy Les Babas-Cool, directed by François Leterrier. She then landed a role in the historical drama Danton (1983), directed by the acclaimed Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emmanuelle-Debever-bio.jpg><p>The film starred Gérard Depardieu as Georges Danton, one of the leaders of the French Revolution, and Debever played his young second wife, Louise Gély. The film was a critical and commercial success, winning the César Award for Best Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film.</p><p>She continued to work with notable directors and actors in the 1980s, such as Jean-Pierre Mocky, Jean-Luc Godard, Michel Piccoli, and Isabelle Huppert. She appeared in films such as A Brutal Game (1983), Grain of Sand (1983), The Detective (1985), and Keep Your Right Up (1987). She also acted in several television programmes, such as The Miser (1980),</p><p>The Charterhouse of Parma (1982), and The Red and the Black (1989). Emmanuelle Debever was praised for her natural and expressive style, as well as her beauty and charm. She was considered a promising young talent in French cinema, with a bright future ahead of her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Withdrawal_from_the_Limelight></span>A Withdrawal from the Limelight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, Emmanuelle Debever career took a downturn in the 1990s, as she struggled to find roles that suited her artistic aspirations. She also faced personal difficulties, such as a divorce and a custody battle for her son. She became disillusioned with the film industry and decided to withdraw from the limelight. She moved to the countryside and devoted herself to painting and writing. She rarely gave interviews or attended public events.</p><p>She said in a 2018 interview that she felt “betrayed” by the cinema world and that she preferred to live a simple and quiet life away from the media attention.</p><p>Debever also revealed that she had suffered from sexual harassment and assault in the film industry, especially from Gérard Depardieu, whom she accused of groping her during the filming of Danton. She said that he had taken advantage of the intimacy inside a carriage, where they had to shoot a scene, and had slid his hand under her skirt, trying to “make her feel better”.</p><p>She said that she had resisted his advances and that he had never apologized or acknowledged his wrongdoing. She said that she had felt “humiliated” and “violated” by his actions and that she had never spoken out before because she feared the consequences for her career and reputation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emmanuelle-Debever-in-a-movie-scene.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Courageous_Testimony></span>A Courageous Testimony<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2019, Emmanuelle Debever decided to break her silence and share her story on Facebook, after learning that Depardieu was facing another accusation of rape and sexual assault from a young actress. She said that she wanted to support the victim and to expose the truth about Depardieu, whom she called a “monster” and a “predator”. She said that she hoped that her testimony would encourage other women to come forward and denounce his behaviour. She also said that she had filed a complaint against him with the police, but that it had been dismissed due to the statute of limitations.</p><p>Her testimony was one of the first to publicly accuse Depardieu of sexual misconduct, and it sparked a media frenzy in France. Depardieu denied the allegations and said that he had never assaulted anyone. He also said that he had no recollection of working with Debever and that he had never heard of her before. He accused her of lying and seeking publicity. He also wrote an open letter to Le Figaro newspaper, in which he defended himself and criticized the media for engaging in a “show trial”. He said that he was the victim of a “witch hunt” and that he had nothing to hide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Death_Details></span>Death Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emmanuelle-Debever-age.jpg><p>On December 6, 2023, Emmanuelle Debever took her own life by jumping into the River Seine in Paris. She left a note at her home, saying that she could not bear the pain and the injustice anymore. She was found by a passer-by and taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her death coincided with the broadcast of a documentary on France 2 television, which featured more allegations against Depardieu, as well as footage of him using lewd language and gestures in the presence of women during a filming trip in North Korea. The documentary also reported that another actress, Charlotte Arnould, had filed a suit against Depardieu in 2018, alleging rape.</p><p>Debever’s death shocked and saddened the French public, as well as the film industry. Many people expressed their condolences and their admiration for her courage and talent. Some also expressed their anger and disgust at Depardieu and the film industry, which they accused of covering up and enabling his behaviour. Several figures from French cinema distanced themselves from Depardieu and said that they would not work with him anymore. France Télévisions said that it was suspending the broadcast of his films. The premier of Quebec, François Legault, said that Depardieu was being excluded from the National Order of Quebec because of his “scandalous remarks”.</p><p>The Paris prosecutor’s office said that it was investigating the cause of Debever’s death, due to the “media reports” of her complaints against Depardieu. It said that it was looking into any possible link between her death and the allegations. It also said that it was continuing the investigations into the other accusations of rape and sexual assault against Depardieu, which he has denied.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Movies></span>Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Role</th></tr><tbody readability=13><tr><td>The Last Metro</td><td>1980</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr><td>The Woman Next Door</td><td>1981</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Return of Martin Guerre</td><td>1982</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr><td>The Moon in the Gutter</td><td>1983</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr><td>Danton</td><td>1983</td><td>Louison Danton</td></tr><tr><td>A Brutal Game</td><td>1983</td><td>Isabelle</td></tr><tr><td>Vive la sociale!</td><td>1983</td><td>Gisèle</td></tr><tr><td>Grain of Sand</td><td>1983</td><td>Midinette</td></tr><tr><td>The Blood of Others</td><td>1984</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr><td>The Little Drummer Girl</td><td>1984</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Paris Seen By… 20 Years After</td><td>1984</td><td>Segment 2</td></tr><tr><td>Quidam</td><td>1984</td><td>Alice</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Belly of an Architect</td><td>1987</td><td>Uncredited</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</td><td>1984</td><td>TV Series, 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>The Hitchhiker</td><td>1985</td><td>TV Series, 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>The New Statesman</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Series, 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>La Barbe-bleue</td><td>1986</td><td>TV Movie, La morte #4</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Joëlle Mazart</td><td>1982</td><td>TV Mini Series, Corinne Heinzi, 6 episodes</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Médecins de nuit</td><td>1986</td><td>TV Series, Marie-Charlotte Morgane, 1 episode</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Les enquêtes du commissaire Maigret</td><td>1989</td><td>TV Series, Rita, 1 episode</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Marc et Sophie</td><td>1988</td><td>TV Series, Emmanuelle, 1 episode</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Secretive_Love_Life></span>A Secretive Love Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to some sources, Debever was married before her suicide, as it has been said that her partner notified the police about her disappearance before she killed herself. However, there is no concrete evidence about who her husband was or if it was just false news.</p><p>Debever was notoriously secretive about her personal life and rarely gave interviews or appeared in public events. She made a handful of films and television shows in the 1980s, but at the end of the decade, she disappeared from the spotlight and lived a reclusive life.</p><p>She never confirmed or denied any rumors about her love life, which included speculation that she had affairs with some of her co-stars, such as Daniel Auteuil, Gerard Lanvin, and even Depardieu himself. She also never spoke about having any children or any other family members.</p><p>Some of her friends and colleagues have suggested that she was a very private and sensitive person who valued her privacy and did not want to expose her personal matters to the media. They have also said that she was deeply affected by the trauma of being assaulted by Depardieu, which she kept secret for decades until she decided to speak out in 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Legacy_of_Bravery_and_Beauty></span>A Legacy of Bravery and Beauty<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emmanuelle Debever was a talented and beautiful actress, who had a promising career in the 1980s, but who chose to leave the film industry and live a secluded life. She was also a brave and outspoken woman, who dared to speak out against one of the most powerful and revered actors in France, and who inspired other women to do the same. She was a victim of sexual violence and injustice, but she was also a survivor and a fighter. She was a human being, who had dreams and hopes, but who also had struggles and pains. She was a person, who deserved respect and dignity, but who also needed support and compassion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGiZoqdfmrqurc2unKWklWKxpq7Er5yrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./simon-cowell-fans-obsess-over-old-clip-showing-his-original-face-on-talk-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Simon Cowell fans obsess over old clip showing his original face on talk show    Thu 22 Dece">&larr;
