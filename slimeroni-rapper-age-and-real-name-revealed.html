She does not speak much about her real name on the internet.</p><p>While she has been rapping under her moniker from the beginning, she got her name Slimeroni from her fans as she revealed in her Interview. Her name is actually two parts combined together. In the first part Slime came because her friends said she was slim and Roni comes in like pepperoni, she combined both names to make her stage name.</p><p>She did not, however, revealed when exactly she started using her moniker but all of her songs on YouTube have been released under her moniker Slimeroni.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-rapper-slimeroni-net-worth></span>What Is Rapper Slimeroni Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rapper Slimeroni has already made a pretty penny out of her music career.</p><p>She has been releasing hit after hit for the past few years and fans have already started noticing the rapper in the Memphis Hip-Hop scene.
